A Algorand wallet demo with Manta protocol integration - https://appia.co -

Key generation and account handling is handled locally, but a Algod node is required to broadcast
transactions.

You need to provide algod host and token in .env.

The wallet is also using Algo Explorer API to check history of transactions.
